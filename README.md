# Project Overview

This project is a simple PHP web server implementation designed to handle HTTP requests and responses. It includes classes for handling requests, generating responses, and running the server.

To run this project, you need to have Composer installed to manage dependencies.

## Running the Server

1. **Install Dependencies:** Run `composer install` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
2. **Run the bat file:** Execute the `server.bat` file to start the PHP server. This file configures the server and sets the port.
3. **Send Requests:** Once the server is running, you can send requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, where `8000` is the default port.
